# KIUCourseProject
Simple project for web server development using TCP sockets.
Program.cs is the file that should be run and while the terminal is still open, you can visit http://localhost:8080/index.html and http://localhost:8080/about.html, any other URL starting with http://localhost:8080 will give an "404: Not Found" error. You can also visit http://localhost:8080/styles.css and http://localhost:8080/script.js, as well as just http://localhost:8080 (this will lead to index.html), but anything that is not .html, .css or .js file, will lead to "403: Forbidden" error.
